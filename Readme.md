# Learning Rust

Welcome to my journey through Rust programming! This repository documents my learning process, challenges, and solutions as I explore the Rust language.


## Projects (So Far...)

### 1. Calculator

A simple command-line calculator built to understand Rust's basic syntax and operations.

### 2. Guessing Game

An interactive number guessing game that helped me grasp Rust's control flow and user input handling.

## Tech Used

### 1. Rust
### 2. A little Logic

## To Copy the code locally
1. Clone the repository
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NullSector-dev/Learning-Rust.git
```

2. Navigate in the project directory
```bash
    cd Learning-Rust
```

## I'll be adding more Projects as I'm learning Rust.
